# python-challenge

Homework collaboration with Elstan Tam.

Python challenge consists of two working files, PyPoll and PyBank.

The challenge for PyBank is:

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period



The challenge for PyPoll is:

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.


For both files, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
